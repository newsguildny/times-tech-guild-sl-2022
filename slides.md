## Unionizing NY Times Tech Workers

### with bubbles and red paint

<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff4040" -->

Notes:

- Intros
- We work at the New York Times, and last year we helped organize the largest
  union of tech workers in the country
- There's an old saying in organizing: "There are no shortcuts in organizing".
  It's totally true; we had literally thousands of one-on-one conversations over
  2 and a half years before we had enough support to go public
- _Buuuuut_, that doesn't mean that there aren't speed boosts!

---

## What we built

<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff4040" -->

- A bubble chart generator <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- A website <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- A Slack avatar generator <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- A live vote count tracker <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

- A bubble chart generator, which allowed us to pinpoint with surgical precision
  where what parts of the organization we had and hadn't spoken to
- A website that allowed us to communicate to the world and to our unit
- A Slack avatar generator that allowed to show support and solidarity in a
  remote-only workplace
- A live vote count tracker that allowed us to have what was possibly the first
  ever fully public union vote count, and build excitement and engagement within
  our unit

### What if alignment came for free?

Notes:

- Before we dive in to the fun stuff, imagine for a moment, a world where you
  never had to hear the word "alignment" ever again
- Maybe you're a product manager, and you spent all of last week trying to
  figure out why your colleague seems to have a completely different definition
  of "scalability" than you do
- Or maybe you're a designer, and you can't figure out why that product manager
  keeps talking about "scalability" when you bring up how there are over a
  hundred slightly different blue buttons in your app
- One theme that we kept noticing is that collaboration just kept sort of...
  happening!
- Because we were all working toward a shared goal, there was never an
  "alignment" phase of the work; everyone improved on everyone else's ideas, and
  we were able to iterate super rapidly

### I ❤️ my job. But...

Notes:

- You work at a company where things are not going quite how you'd like.
- Maybe there's something big going wrong: maybe you're working long hours, and
  you never get to spend time with your partner.
- Maybe you're being forced to return to the office, after multiple years of
  successful remote work.
- Maybe it's a pizza party where your raise should be.
- Maybe it's a series of frustrating working conditions that are causing low
  retention at your job. Nothing huge on its own...but things add up over time.

- Here's the rub: you love your job. You're good at what you do and you care
  about your co-workers, so you can't just quit. You want to make the company a
  better place to work, for everyone...but what are your other options?

---

### POV: You're called into a furtive conversation with a coworker.

Notes:

- "Hey!" your friend says. "Can we talk?"
- You get pulled into a conference room, a phone call, or a zoom meeting...and
  your friend starts describing the same things you've been noticing.

## Organizing

Data-driven decisions

<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff4040" -->

Notes:

- You know that you want to work together with your coworkers to make the
  company a better place to work.
- There are a few different ways to do that, legally speaking, but the most
  important thing is to get everyone on board, working together. You need to get
  the largest number of people possible collaborating on this, to build strong
  solidarity

---

### The Goal

Map out union support across the company

---

### How much does someone support the union?

1. All in! Let's organize! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Yes! Keep me updated! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. I need to know more <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. I don't think so... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Thank you, but no <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### PS: Don't get caught!

Notes:

- it's not illegal
- you're in fact protected in doing this!
- but it's strategic to get all of your ducks in a row before management find
  sout

### Time to phone a friend!

And ask them to phone some friends too...

Notes:

- What would it look like if you talked to everyone you worked closely with, and
  could trust to keep a secret?

### Lesson #1

People are busy

Notes:

Turns out, the hardest part of building a website for your union is the same as
the hardest part of buliding the rest of the union: organizing!

The first issue we had was actually getting enough people to dedicate enough
time to get something working.

Over the course of about 5 months, we worked in small spurts, usually one day at
a time

## A Show of Solidarity <!-- .element: style="width: 400px; padding-left: 250px; color: #ff4040;" -->

<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#ff4040" data-background-image="dist/images/guild-frame-square-1.png", data-background-size="contain" -->

---

### The Big Question

Note:

- The first thing that happens when a unit goes public is that we ask management
  to voluntarily recognize us.
- Throughout the campaign, we'd been gathering hundreds of signed cards from
  coworkers that were supportive of the union
- It's in everyone's best interest for management to just say yes, but they'll
  only do it if it feels like a vote would be redundant anyway

---

### It's not enough to have the numbers

We also have _look_ like we have the numbers!

Notes:

- We needed a way to make it obvious to management how much support we had,
  which was a lot
- Buuuuut no one was in the office!

---

### Attempt #1

Google Slides, and a lot of documentation

Notes:

- Like any good, scrappy product, the first step was to actually figure out what
  we wanted to build
- Started with a mock from a designer in Google Slides. Each slide was a
  template, and you could add a photo and then export the slide as a new picture
- Then, everyone could have a nice Guild frame around their Slack avatars!
- Slack avatars are super visible when everyone's remote
- Even for very technical users, this was too many steps to follow

---

### Attempt #2

Olov has an idea

Notes:

- An engineer, more or less on a whim, decided to make a super rough tool to
  make the process easier
- The idea isn't new; people used to make these all the time in early social
  media days
- Cut out as much complexity as possible: no server, no database, all static
  files, free hosting (surge.sh)

---

### Swarm

Fun ideas have their own gravity

Notes:

- Another engineer (Romina), and another designer (Riley) were excited enough
  about the idea to hop in and help out
- Designer had the idea to support preview, and show all of the frames at once,
  try out new photos from the same page
- Romina implemented the new design
