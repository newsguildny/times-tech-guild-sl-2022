### Lesson #1

People are busy

Notes:

Turns out, the hardest part of building a website for your union is the same as
the hardest part of buliding the rest of the union: organizing!

The first issue we had was actually getting enough people to dedicate enough
time to get something working.

Over the course of about 5 months, we worked in small spurts, usually one day at
a time

### The Big Question

Note:

- The first thing that happens when a unit goes public is that we ask management
  to voluntarily recognize us.
- Throughout the campaign, we'd been gathering hundreds of signed cards from
  coworkers that were supportive of the union
- It's in everyone's best interest for management to just say yes, but they'll
  only do it if it feels like a vote would be redundant anyway

---

### It's not enough to have the numbers

We also have _look_ like we have the numbers!

Notes:

- We needed a way to make it obvious to management how much support we had,
  which was a lot
- Buuuuut no one was in the office!

---

### Attempt #1

Google Slides, and a lot of documentation

Notes:

- Like any good, scrappy product, the first step was to actually figure out what
  we wanted to build
- Started with a mock from a designer in Google Slides. Each slide was a
  template, and you could add a photo and then export the slide as a new picture
- Then, everyone could have a nice Guild frame around their Slack avatars!
- Slack avatars are super visible when everyone's remote
- Even for very technical users, this was too many steps to follow

---

### Attempt #2

Olov has an idea

Notes:

- An engineer, more or less on a whim, decided to make a super rough tool to
  make the process easier
- The idea isn't new; people used to make these all the time in early social
  media days
- Cut out as much complexity as possible: no server, no database, all static
  files, free hosting (surge.sh)

---

### Swarm

Fun ideas have their own gravity

Notes:

- Another engineer (Romina), and another designer (Riley) were excited enough
  about the idea to hop in and help out
- Designer had the idea to support preview, and show all of the frames at once,
  try out new photos from the same page
- Romina implemented the new design
